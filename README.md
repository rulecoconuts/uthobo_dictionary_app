# dictionary_app

## Goal
The goal of this app is to give its users the ability to preserve and resuscitate a language of their choosing.
In a world where over half of all languages are endangered, we cannot rely only on major language-learning apps.
Over 1500 languages could dissappear by the end of the century if things continue as they are.

With this app, translations can be added to link endangered languages to themselves, and major languages.

Translations contain a written spelling, and also a pronunciation. <br/>

<br/><br/>
Pronunciations are mainly audio recordings that may be accompanied by phonetic spellings. Audio data can later be processed by the backend to create automatic-translation machine-learning models
