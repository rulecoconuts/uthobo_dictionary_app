# dictionary_app

## Goal
The goal of this app is to give its users the ability to preserve and resuscitate a language of their choosing.
In a world where over half of all languages are endangered, we cannot rely only on major language-learning apps.

With this app, translations can be added to link endangered languages to themselves, and major languages.

Translations contain a written spelling, and also a pronunciation.

Pronunciations are mainly audio recordings than can be accompanied by phonetic spellings
